## About the Project
The American adult animated television series "Rick and Morty," created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon in 2013 for Adult Swim, has captivated a wide audience with its unique blend of science fiction, humor, and exploration of human relationships. The series follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez, an eccentric scientist, and his impressionable grandson, Morty, as they embark on adventures across dimensions, time, and intergalactic space. This repository presents a project that uses this series as inspiration to create a social network that reflects the relationships between its characters based on their interactions and dialogues in the first three seasons. Additionally, the article simulates the unexpected spread of a virus within this network, focusing on the intricately connected secondary characters within the network structure. The project illustrates how social network analysis techniques can be applied to understand relationships and patterns in a fictional context, combining elements of data science, narrative, and entertainment.

## Objective
The main objective of the project is to create a social network that reflects the relationships between the characters of "Rick and Morty" based on their interactions and dialogues in the first three seasons. Additionally, the spread of a virus is simulated within this network, focusing on the secondary characters connected within the network structure.

## State of the Art
In the context of this project, two notable works in social network analysis were taken as references. First, it was based on the video "Network of The Witcher â€” Relationship Extraction Network Analysis with Spacy and NetworkX" presented by Thu Vu, which explores the relationships between the characters of the "The Witcher" saga. The analysis uses centrality measures and community detection techniques to delve deeper into the interactions within the network. Second, inspiration was taken from the project "GOTNetwork Analysis" by Harsh Jobanputra, which created a network for the characters of the series "A Song of Ice and Fire" and simulated the spread of rumors based on independent cascades. This project also explored the relevance and importance of the characters throughout the saga using specific analysis methods.
