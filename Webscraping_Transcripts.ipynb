      "Beth\n",
      ": Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong.\n",

We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let's get some fresh air.\n",
      "Morty\n",
      ": Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things.\n",

      "Rick\n",
      ": I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.\n",
      "Beth\n",
      ": So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine. Did that not even happen?\n",

      "Nicky\n",

      "Nazi\n",
      ": I'm comfortable being called a nazi. You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings? (Hits Nicky on the head) Yeah. Think before you talk shit. Rah-gubaba, help me kill america! (Mr. Beauregard knocks out the nazi)\n",

      ": Wait.\n",
      "Summer\n",
      ": And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble. ( laughter )\n",

      "But there's always been 10.\n",
      "Rick\n",

      "Frankenstein\n",
      ": You sure about that, Rick?\n",

      ": Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. ( grunts )\n",

      "Rick\n",
      ": Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam.\n",

      "Summer\n",
      ": Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.\n",

      "Summer\n",
      ": He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!\n",

      "Cornvelious Daniel\n",
      ": Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film \"Mulan,\" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.\n",

It’ll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clone’s job is done.

But I was desperate to touch you, so I wiped my palm on the grass next to me. But a Snickers wrapper kind of got stuck on it, so I started kind of jiggling it, whipping it without moving too much. But you started looking over, and I thought, \"Well, this is it. She's going to see that I'm a loser,\" and I'll never get to touch her. \"But I still have time to touch her. \" But my hand had Snickers on it, and the brass section was swelling because it was the scene with the guy melting in the lava.
